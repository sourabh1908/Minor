The position is set to relative so we can use the z-index property; the default position value is static, which ignores z-index

We use text-align to center our text and button

We use padding-top to vertically center our div, since it's contents take up quite a bit of space we use 40vh (view height) instead of 50, this way the content looks more visually centered

Notice the animation property at the bottom of this rule, this is how we add an animation to an element; in this case we have an animation named imageAnimation that lasts for 50s (seconds), keeps linear timing (the whole animation runs at the same speed), and loops an infinite number of times

    Each list item needs a background-image and the last four need an animation-delay (this way they all fire off one after the other in ten second intervals):
